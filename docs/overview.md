# Flux Kontext Overview

Flux Kontext is an advanced AI image editor and generator designed for creators, photographers, and developers.  
It combines AI headshot generation, image restoration, and contextual editing â€” giving users total creative control in a single workspace.

### Why It Stands Out
- Context-aware editing for characters and scenes  
- LoRA and ControlNet compatibility  
- Batch image generation for faster results  
- Pro and Max editions tailored for different workloads  

Flux Kontext helps users generate consistent visuals for branding, art direction, portrait photography, and restoration.
